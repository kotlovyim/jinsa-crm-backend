## ‚úèÔ∏è Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Closes #123
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Standards

- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task

### Documentation
